RPG System Goals
================

All rules created should:

* Be as simple as it possibly can be and still be fun.
* Emphasize speed of play
* Reward the players for making interesting and unique decisions during character creation and play
* Be easy to remember - looking things up during gameplay is a mood killer
* Enable GMs to roll with the punches of player action by providing a general framework instead of specifics
* encourage realistic (for a given value of realistic) behavior from players
* discourage min-maxing and repetitive behavior
* **Every. Single. Rule. should make the game more fun. If it doesn't then it shouldn't be there.**
