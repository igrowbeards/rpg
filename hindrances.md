Hindrances
===========

Hindrances are traits and mannerisms that negatively effect your character.
You can take up to 10 points in hindrances, and at least one hindrance is required.
Points from hindrances your character starts with can be spent to increase skills, attributes, or to buy edges.
Points from hindrances you aquire during play can be spent on skills or edges only.

Unless otherwise noted hindrances grant extra points based on the degree to which they
affect your character as determined by agreement between player and GM.
Rough guidelines are that minor hindrances are worth 2 points and major are worth 4-5.
It is possible to have higher or lower point values, but lower would need to be rarely inconvenient
(a missing arm that has been replaced by a magic prosthetic, but can be disrupted by enemy magic users)
or very hindering (an absolute pacifist who refuses to harm any living animal/creature, sentient or not)
