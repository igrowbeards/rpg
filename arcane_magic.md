Spellcasting
==============

When creating a spell a spellcaster must pick at least 2 dependencies from the following:

	* Focus Object - you require a specific one of a kind object (usually hand crafted by the mage) in order to cast this spell properly
	* Arcane Gesture - you must make a certain gesture in order to properly focus the energy for this spell
	* Magic Words - you must speak a certain phrase in order to properly focus the energy for this spell -
		the phrase can be any volume from a scream to a loud whisper but must be audible.

If you must cast a spell without a selected dependency you suffer a -3 to your casting roll *per dependency not met*
A user may choose to take all three dependencies for a spell and a +2 to their casting rolls (for this spell only)

A character purchases spells the same way as skills.

All spells have 3 components, base effect, modifiers, and trappings.

Once again you'll have to work with your GM to create spells for your character that are fun and unique
but the proper strength for the campaign he's created.

Your base effect is the building block of your character
modifiers change the way the spell works to help keep things unique
and altering the look and feel allows you to customize the "flavor" of the spell to your character.

Some general GM guidelines for spells:

Creating spells is a delicate balancing act. You want to make sure that your parties mage is an important
part of the group without being overpowered and making the other players feel unneeded.

There are several components that can be tweaked in order to balance a spell, as GM you are free to (and encouraged to) change
these. Magic in (Currently Unnamed) is not a science but an art and one with many variables at that. Any player who may be prone to
being upset if their character is "nerfed" is encouraged **not** to play a magic user.
