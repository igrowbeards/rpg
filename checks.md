Skill and Ability Checks
========================

Skill and ability checks are made versus a target number determined by how difficult the task is.

Even though you roll multiple dice in (currently unnamed) you always only take the highest.

All skill and ability checks are rolled with penetrating dice. What this means is that if you roll the highest number
on a die (6 on a d6, 8 on a d8, etc) you roll that die again and add the result -1 to your original roll.
The same die may be re-rolled infinitely (at -1 each time) as long as it continues to come up the max result.

For example:

Tim roll a toughness check to fight off a cold.
He rolls his toughness of 3d4 and gets a 1, a 3, and a 4.
Since 4 is the highest number you can roll on that die type Tim gets to reroll that die and add the new result minus one to the original result of 4.
This time he rolls a 3, one is subtracted bringing his second roll total down to 2
which is then added to his original four for a total of six.

Unfortunately this is a tough bug and Tim's six isn't good enough to fight it off.
Tim comes down ill and passes the disease to Trevor. Trevor now has to make a challenging toughness check
in order to avoid getting sick as well.

Trevor rolls his 3d6 of toughness dice, and comes up with a 2, a 4, and a 6.
He rolls his bonus die for the six and rolls another six. So far his total is 11
 - 6 for the original 6 he rolled and 5 for the second six (subsequent rolls are made at -1).
Since he maxed out his die again he gets to add *another* bonus die and this time he rolls a 1 on his d6.
Unfortunately since all bonus rolls are made at -1 the second bonus roll is a wash and his total stays at 11.
Luckily for him is enough to fight of the disease and he ca go about his business.
