Skill and Ability Checks
========================

Skill and ability checks are made versus a target number determined by how difficult the task is.

Even though you roll multiple dice in (currently unnamed) you always only take the highest.

All skill and ability checks are rolled with penetrating dice. What this means is that if you roll the highest number
on a die (6 on a d6, 8 on a d8, etc) you roll that die again and add the result -1 to your original roll.
The same die may be re-rolled infinitely (at -1 each time) as long as it continues to come up the max result.

For example:

Tim roll a toughness check to fight off a cold.
He rolls his toughness of 3d4 and gets a 1, a 3, and a 4.
Since 4 is the highest number you can roll on that die type Tim gets to reroll that die and add the new result minus one to the original result of 4.
This time he rolls a 3, one is subtracted bringing his second roll total down to 2
which is then added to his original four for a total of six.

Unfortunately this is a tough bug and Tim's six isn't good enough to fight it off.
Tim comes down ill and passes the disease to Trevor. Trevor now has to make a challenging toughness check
in order to avoid getting sick as well.

Trevor rolls his 3d6 of toughness dice, and comes up with a 2, a 4, and a 6.
He rolls his bonus die for the six and rolls another six. So far his total is 11
 - 6 for the original 6 he rolled and 5 for the second six (subsequent rolls are made at -1).
Since he maxed out his die again he gets to add *another* bonus die and this time he rolls a 1 on his d6.
Unfortunately since all bonus rolls are made at -1 the second bonus roll is a wash and his total stays at 11.
Luckily for him is enough to fight of the disease and he ca go about his business.

Ability Checks
--------------

To roll an ability check simply roll the quantity and type of dice equal to your ability score.

Skill Checks
------------

All skills have a root attribute. The root attribute determines the type of die you roll while
your rank in the skill determines the number of dice you roll. The maximum amount of skill points is five.


Opposed Rolls
-------------

Some rolls are rolled against another player or npc instead of against a static target number.
Examples might be if your character tried to hit someone who was actively trying not to get hit,
or trying to coerce information out of prisoner. In the first case you would be rolling your
fighting ability versus theirs. In the second case you might be rolling your charisma ability
score versus the prisoners willpower ability score.


Critical Success
----------------
Every multiple of the target number counts as an extra success. Regarding skill and ability checks
this normally just means that you accomplish your goal particularly well.


Critical Failures
-----------------
If more than half your dice come up as 1's you just rolled a critical failure. Not only do you fail your check
(no matter what you highest roll was) but you fail spectacularly. A general guideline for GM's is that
if the task is something where the consequences of failure are generally non-lethal the failure should
be as inconvenient as possible for the player rolling it and the party as a whole, and maybe even
cause a small amount of damage to the character rolling it. If the task is a check that will avoid
damage, then double the damage done.
