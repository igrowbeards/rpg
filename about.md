A (Currently Unnamed) RPG Ruleset
=================================

(Currently Unnamed) is an rpg ruleset created by Justin Edwards.
It is meant to be a simple and fast play system that allows for a lot of dm and player flexibility and encourages true character creation.
Accordingly the ruleset is purposefully thin, instead of tables and tables full of modifiers for every situation I've tried to create
a system that sets the smallest number of guidelines as possible and provides some intelligent defaults for deciding difficulties of checks.

(Currently Unnamed) is heavily inspired by:
	* Savage Worlds from Pinnacle Publishing
	* Dungeons and Dragons 3.5
