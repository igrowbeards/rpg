Edges
===========

Edges can be purchased with points earned from taking hindrances or with leftover skill points.
Some edges have specific bonuses in their descriptions and others are more general.
If you think you have an edge that should give you a bonus in a situation just mention it to your DM,
In most cases an applicable minot edge would give you a +2 to a check, and a major would
grant a +4 but this may be more or less according to DM interpretation.
