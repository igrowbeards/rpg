Combat in the (Currently Unnamed) System
========================================

###Actions
	Roll Quickness against a target number of 5. You get one action by default. Each success and raise gives you
	One additional action this round. If you go bust on your quickness roll you get no actions this round.
	Once you have determined the number of actions, roll one of your quickness die type once for each action.

	After everyone has rolled their initiative the dm will start with the highest number rolled and begin counting down from there.
	When they call your number you may act. In cases of a tie when who goes first matters
	(two characters in melee both have the same initiative score) roll quickness checks for both characters - the highest goes first.

###Movement
	Characters can move 3 times their size per action spent.

###Ranged Attacks

	All ranged weapons have a range of 15 feet (3 squares if playing on a battle grid map)
	Every increase of the range adds a +2 to the difficulty class for fired weapons and a +4 for thrown weapons.
	Fired weapons do the listed damage, Thrown weapons do the listed damage + strength, up to the dietype of the weapon.

	For example if you throw an axe that does 2d6 plus strength: and roll a 4 on your 2d6 damage roll and then roll your strength of 3d8
	getting 12, only 6 of those str bonus points are applied to damage.

	Shooting into a melee: Sometimes it's necessary to shoot into a melee. If you don't care if you hit
	any of the participants fire as normal. If you are trying to hit only one/some of the melee participants
	you must subtract a -4 from

	Sometimes you may want to make a called shot, for example to exploit a weakness in a dragons armor,
	or to take someone out of a fight without killing them. The added difficulty cis proportionate to the size of the chosen target.

	A large area - for example a humans thigh or chest + 4
	A medium sized area - for example a humans arm or lower leg + 6
	A small area - for example a humans hand, foot, ankle, or head + 8
	A very small area - just a few square inches +10
	An incredibly small area - just large enough for the weapon, examples: the eye holes in a plate helm, a keyhole + 15

###Melee Attacks

All attacks where the opponent is aware of the attacker are opposed rolls.
Typically but not always (GM discretion) this is either their fighting skill or dexterity ability (for dodging)

Success allows damage roll


If you lose your attack roll nothing happens. If your opponenent gets a raise
lose and action (if you have one to lose), if you go bust on a mellee attack roll
your target gets an automatic attack on you even if they are out of actions.
Defending never takes an action.

Melee Weapons do the damage listed plus your str bonus. On melee attacks there is no limit to the str bonus.

###Unarmed Attacks

Unarmed attacks work just like armed attacks except that they only do temporary damage. If "killed"
by unarmed attacks you are knocked out and awake with 1 real wound level after 1d4 rounds

Certain edges or skills allow you to choose to do lethal damage with unarmed attacks

###Active Defense

You can use an action to add +4 to your next defense roll. If you take any attacks or movement actions before you are attacked
you lose the bonus entirely. If you take any simple actions that don't require much movement
(drinking a potion, drawing a small weapon, prepping a spell) this bonus is reduced to -2.
Taking more than one action of this kind negates the bonus entirely.

###Non-combat actions in Combat

Taking a non-combat action while in melee can provoke an attack of opportunity. This means that
anyone in melee with you can discard their highest action (even is it isn't time for it) to make an immediate
attack roll.

###Determining Hit Location

There are two ways to handle this - the first if that only players and important npcs take damage to specific locations - this option makes the game go faster.
The other option is that you always roll hit location for every character - this will make the combat take longer but may be more fun if your group is into that.

**Rolling to determine hit location:**

Roll a d20:

   20...head
17-19...torso
14-16...right arm
11-13...left arm
   10...vitals
  7-9...torso
  4-6...right leg
  1-3...left leg

If you hit in the vitals add and extra d6 of damage. If you hit in the head add an extra 2d6 of damage.

For each size category you are smaller than your opponent subtract 2 from the roll up to a miximum of -6.
There is no change for being larger than another creature.
(It's much easier for a giant to crush a goblins foot with his club than it is for a goblin to stab a giant in the eye.)

###Taking Damage
You take wounds for every multiple of your size that is dealt to you in damage:

Diminutive: 1
(ex a single rat, a frog)
Tiny : 2
(ex a cat, a racoon)
Very Small: 3
(a gnome, a corgi)
Small: 4
(a halfling, an average sized dog)
Medium: 5
(an average human, a great dane)
Large: 6
(an average half-orc, a horse)
Very Large: 7
(a full sized orc, a small dragon)
Huge: 8
(an ogre, a medium dragon)
Giant: 9
(a hill giant, an adult dragon)
Colossal: 10
(the statue of liberty, an ancient dragon)

###Armor

Armor reduces damage taken after you are hit by 1 point for each armor level. If someone is hit and chooses to discard their next action
they can make an armor check vs. a target of 8 to reduce the damage.
If they pass their armor check they can roll their armor's damage reduction die and subtract this from the damage taken.

Example Armor:

Leather:
Armor Level - 1
Maneuverability - 4
Active reduction -  1d4

Chain Mail:
Armor Level - 2
Maneuverability - 6
Active reduction -  1d6

Half Plate:
Armor Level - 3
Maneuverability - 8
Active reduction -  2d6

Plate Mail:
Armor Level - 4
Maneuverability - 12
Active reduction -  1d8

Each armor level reduces your dexterity by 1 level. For example if you have 3d8 in dexterity and are wearing half plate your
dexterity when wearing your armor would be 3d6 (2 steps, 3d8 > 2d8 > 1d8 > 3d6).

###Shields

(i really have no idea how to bring shields into this...)
