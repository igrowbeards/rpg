Combat in the (Currently Unnamed) System
========================================

###Actions
	Roll Quickness against a target number of 5. You get one action by default. Each success and raise gives you
	One additional action this round. If you go bust on your quickness roll you get no actions this round.
	Once you have determined the number of actions, roll one of your quickness die type once for each action.

	After everyone has rolled their initiative the dm will start with the highest number rolled and begin counting down from there.
	When they call your number you may act. In cases of a tie when who goes first matters
	(two characters in melee both hve the same initiative score) roll quickness checks for both characters - the highest goes first.

###Movement
	Characters can move 3 times their size per action spent.

###Ranged Attacks

	All ranged weapons have a range of 15 feet (3 squares if playing on a battle grid map)
	Every increase of the range adds a +2 to the difficulty class for fired weapons and a +4 for thrown weapons.
	Fired weapons do the listed damage, Thrown weapons do the listed damage + strength, up to the dietype of the weapon.

	For example if you throw an axe that does 2d6 plus strength: and roll a 4 on your 2d6 damage roll and then roll your strength of 3d8
	getting 12, only 6 of those str bonus points are applied to damage.

	Shooting into a melee: Sometimes it's necessary to shoot into a melee. If you don't care if you hit
	any of the participants fire as normal. If you are trying to hit only one/some of the melee participants
	you must subtract a -4 from

	Sometimes you may want to make a called shot, for example to exploit a weakness in a dragons armor,
	or to take someone out of a fight without killing them. The added difficulty cis proportionate to the size of the chosen target.

	A large area - for example a humans thigh or chest + 4
	A medium sized area - for example a humans arm or lower leg + 6
	A small area - for example a humans hand, foot, ankle, or head + 8
	A very small area - just a few square inches +10
	An incredibly small area - just large enough for the weapon, examples: the eye holes in a plate helm, a keyhole + 15

###Melee Attacks

All attacks where the opponent is aware of the attacker are opposed rolls.
Typically but not always (GM discretion) this is either their fighting skill or dexterity ability (for dodging)

Success allows damage roll

Any amount of raises adds 1d6 of damage to the damage roll

If you lose your attack roll nothing happens. If your opponenent gets a raise
on you lose and action (if you have one to lose), if you go bust on a mellee attack roll
your target gets an automatic attack on you even if they are out of actions.

Melee Weapons do the damage listed plus your str bonus. On melee attacks there is no limit to the str bonus.

###Unarmed Attacks

Unarmed attacks work just like armed attacks except that they only do temporary damage. If "killed"
by unarmed attacks you are knocked out and awake with 1 real wound level after 1d4 rounds

Certain edges or skills allow you to choose to do lethal damage with unarmed attacks

###Active Defense

You can use an action to add +4 to your next defense roll. If you take any attacks or movement actions before you are attacked
you lose the bonus entirely. If you take any simple actions that don't require much movement
(drinking a potion, drawing a small weapon, prepping a spell) this bonus is reduced to -2.
Taking more than one action of this kind negates the bonus entirely.

###Non-combat actions in Combat

Taking a non-combat action while in melee can provoke an attack of opportunity. This means that
anyone in melee with you can discard their highest action (even is it isn't time for it) to make an immediate
attack roll.
