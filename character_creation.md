TK

### Step Two: Assign Ability Scores

In (Currently Unnamed) there are 7 ability scores that
represent your characters' physical and mental capabilities

  1. Strength
  2. Dexterity
  3. Health
  4. Quickness
  5. Intelligence
  6. Charisma
  7. Willpower

All abilities scores have two components, the first is the number of dice the second is the die type.
The die-type represents the characters "maximum" ability (barring lucky breaks*) while the number of dice represent their consistency with that ability.
The maximum die-type that a character may have in a skill is a d12 - the maximum number of dice is 3.

To generate your seven ability scores roll 1d6 and 1d10 seven times.
The d10 determines your die type and the d6 determines the dice quantity for that skill.
Once you have your seven dice combinations assign them to the attributes of your choice.

** Dice quantity determined by d6 result **

1-3: 1
4-5: 2
  6: 3

** Die type determined by d12 result **

1-4: d4
5-7: d6
8-9: d8
 10: d12
